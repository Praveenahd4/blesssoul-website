<p><strong>Specific Jurisdiction:</strong> The laws of the State of Karnataka, India shall apply.</p>
<p><strong>NO US LAW:</strong> These Terms are NOT governed by California law, United States law, or any other foreign jurisdiction law. Indian law exclusively applies.</p>
<h3>21.2 Exclusive Jurisdiction</h3>
<p><strong>CRITICAL - INDIAN JURISDICTION WITH MANDATORY CONSUMER RIGHTS EXCEPTIONS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Rule (Non-Consumer Users):</strong><br />
- <strong>All disputes</strong> arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be subject to the <strong>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Shivamogga, Karnataka, India</strong><br />

<p><strong>EXCEPTION for EU/UK/Swiss Consumers:</strong></p>

- EU Regulation 1215/2012 (Brussels I Regulation - Recast)<br />

<p>For EU/UK/Swiss consumer disputes:<br />
- You may bring claims in either (a) courts of Shivamogga, Karnataka, India, OR (b) courts of your country of residence<br />
- We may only bring claims against you in courts of your country of residence<br />
- This does not waive our other protections (mediation, fee shifting within your jurisdiction, liability caps)</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTION for California Consumers:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing in this section waives rights provided by the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act or other mandatory California consumer protection laws that cannot be waived by contract.</p>
<p><strong>For All Other Users:</strong><br />
- Exclusive jurisdiction remains in Shivamogga, Karnataka, India<br />

<h3>21.3 Mandatory Mediation Before Litigation</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE filing any lawsuit, YOU MUST:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contact us for informal resolution:</strong></li>
<li>Email: support@blesssoul.com</li>
<li>Provide detailed description of the dispute</li>
<li>Allow <strong>60 days</strong> for good-faith informal resolution attempts</li>
<li>
<p>Most disputes can be resolved quickly and amicably through communication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If informal resolution fails, MANDATORY MEDIATION:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Disputes must proceed to <strong>mediation</strong> before litigation</li>
<li>Mediation shall be conducted in <strong>Shivamogga, Karnataka, India</strong></li>
<li>Mediation shall be conducted in <strong>English or Kannada</strong></li>
<li>Each party bears their own mediation costs</li>
<li>Mediation must occur before any court filing</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimum 60-day mediation period required</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Only after mediation fails may litigation proceed:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Litigation only in courts of Shivamogga, Karnataka, India</li>
<li>No litigation in any other jurisdiction</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Consequence of Non-Compliance:</strong><br />
- Failure to attempt informal resolution and mediation before litigation may result in dismissal of your claim<br />
- You may be responsible for our legal costs incurred defending improperly filed claims</p>
<h3>21.4 Fee Shifting - Loser Pays</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT COST CONSEQUENCE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In any litigation or dispute resolution proceeding, the <strong>losing party shall pay the winning party's reasonable legal fees and costs</strong></li>
<li>This includes attorney fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses</li>
<li>This applies whether you are the plaintiff or defendant</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Discourages frivolous lawsuits and incentivizes good-faith dispute resolution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this means for you:</strong><br />
- If you sue and lose, you pay our legal costs (in addition to your own)<br />
- If you sue and win, we pay your legal costs<br />
- If we sue you and lose, we pay your legal costs<br />
- If we sue you and win, you pay our legal costs</p>
<p><strong>Solo Developer Protection:</strong><br />
- This clause protects a solo developer from being bankrupted by defending against frivolous claims<br />
- Even if we win a frivolous lawsuit, legal costs could be devastating without fee recovery<br />
- By using BlessSoul, you agree this protection is fair and reasonable</p>
<h3>21.5 Frivolous Lawsuit Penalty</h3>
<p><strong>PENALTY FOR BAD-FAITH LITIGATION:</strong></p>
<p>If any court determines that you filed a lawsuit that is:<br />
- Frivolous (lacking legal merit)<br />
- Brought in bad faith<br />
- Intended to harass or burden the developer<br />
- Filed in violation of these Terms (e.g., wrong jurisdiction, no mediation)</p>
<p><strong>YOU AGREE TO PAY A PENALTY OF ₹50,000 INR (Fifty Thousand Indian Rupees)</strong> to the developer, in addition to:<br />
- All legal fees and costs (per Section 21.4)<br />
- Any damages awarded<br />
- Any other remedies available to the developer</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Protects solo developer from malicious or harassing litigation that could destroy a one-person business.</p>
<h3>21.6 No Class Actions</h3>
<p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</strong></p>
<p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY</strong> and NOT as part of a:<br />
- Class action lawsuit<br />
- Class arbitration<br />
- Representative action<br />
- Collective action<br />
- Mass action</p>
<p><strong>You waive any right to:</strong><br />
- Participate in a class action against BlessSoul<br />
- Act as a class representative<br />
- Act as a private attorney general<br />
- Consolidate your claim with other users' claims</p>
<p><strong>Each user may only bring claims individually.</strong></p>
<p>If this class action waiver is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the entire dispute resolution provision (Section 21) shall be null and void, but the rest of these Terms remain in effect.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Protects solo developer from existential threat of class action lawsuits, which could bankrupt a one-person operation even if meritless.</p>
<h3>21.7 Waiver of Foreign Jurisdiction</h3>
<p><strong>EXPLICIT WAIVER:</strong></p>
<p>By using BlessSoul, you <strong>explicitly and irrevocably waive</strong> any right to:<br />
- Sue in United States courts (federal or state)<br />
- Sue in California courts<br />
- Sue in courts outside India<br />
- Invoke jurisdiction based on your location<br />
- Claim inconvenience of Indian jurisdiction<br />
- Seek removal to foreign courts</p>
<p><strong>You acknowledge:</strong><br />
- You are entering into a contract with an Indian developer<br />
- Indian jurisdiction is appropriate and expected<br />
- You accept the inconvenience (if any) of Indian jurisdiction as a condition of using the Service<br />
- This waiver is knowing, voluntary, and informed</p>
<h3>21.8 Small Claims Exception - REMOVED</h3>
<p><strong>THERE IS NO SMALL CLAIMS COURT EXCEPTION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALL claims</strong>, regardless of amount, must follow the procedures in Section 21</li>
<li>Informal resolution → Mediation → Shivamogga courts only</li>
<li>No small claims court in any jurisdiction</li>
<li>No exceptions for low-value claims</li>
</ul>
<h3>21.9 Limitation Period</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any claim arising from these Terms or the Service must be filed within <strong>ONE (1) YEAR</strong> from the date the claim arose</li>
<li>Claims filed after one year are <strong>permanently barred</strong></li>
<li>This limitation applies regardless of any statute of limitations in your jurisdiction</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides finality and prevents old claims from arising years later</li>
</ul>
<h3>21.10 Severability of Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>If any court finds any provision of Section 21 (Dispute Resolution) to be invalid or unenforceable:<br />
- The invalid provision shall be severed<br />
- The remaining provisions of Section 21 remain in full force and effect<br />
- The invalid provision shall be replaced with a valid provision that most closely matches the intent</p>
<h3>21.11 Mandatory Consumer Protection Rights</h3>
<p><strong>Preservation of Statutory Consumer Rights:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms limits, excludes, or restricts your statutory rights as a consumer under applicable mandatory consumer protection laws that cannot be waived by contract.</p>

<p><strong>In Case of Conflict:</strong></p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms conflicts with mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction, the mandatory consumer protection laws shall prevail <strong>to the extent of the conflict</strong>. All other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>
