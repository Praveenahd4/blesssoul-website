<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>BlessSoul ("we," "our," or "us") is developed and operated by <strong>Praveena H D</strong>, a sole proprietor and individual developer based in <strong>Shivamogga, Karnataka, India</strong>.

<li><strong>Limited infrastructure:</strong> Data protection measures reflect solo developer resources, not enterprise-level systems</li>
<li><strong>Good-faith efforts:</strong> We make good-faith efforts to protect your privacy and honor your rights within our capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We take your privacy seriously and comply with all applicable privacy laws, though response times may be at the maximum allowed by law due to the one-person operation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong><br />
- All data transmitted between your device and our servers uses <strong>HTTPS/TLS 1.3 encryption</strong><br />

<p><strong>Access Controls:</strong><br />
- <strong>Row-level security:</strong> Users can only access their own data in Supabase<br />

<p><strong>Biometric Protection (Optional):</strong><br />
- Diary access can be protected with <strong>Face ID/Touch ID</strong><br />
- Biometric data is processed <strong>locally by iOS</strong> and never sent to us or stored<br />

- No routine access to user content<br />
- Database queries require authentication and are logged<br />
- Developer cannot view encrypted diary entries (keys are device-only)</p>
<p><strong>LIMITATION:</strong> As a solo developer, we cannot provide enterprise-level security infrastructure, dedicated security team, or 24/7 monitoring. We implement best practices within our resource constraints.</p>

<h2>9. Diary Content Analysis (Local NLP Processing)</h2>
<h3>9.1 Soul Spark Quote Personalization</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE:</strong> BlessSoul uses LOCAL natural language processing (NLP) to analyze keywords in your diary entries for quote personalization in the "Soul Spark" feature.</p>
<p><strong>What We Analyze:</strong><br />
- <strong>Keywords and mood-related words</strong> in your diary text (e.g., "stressed," "happy," "anxious," "work," "love," "family")<br />
- <strong>Emotional context</strong> to suggest relevant inspirational quotes<br />
- <strong>Analysis happens ON YOUR DEVICE ONLY</strong> - your diary content is NEVER sent to servers<br />
- <strong>No human ever reads your diary</strong> - processing is automated and local</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- You write in your diary: "Feeling anxious about work presentations"<br />
- Local NLP detects keywords: "anxious," "work"<br />
- App suggests quotes about: Calm, Confidence, Professional Success<br />
- Your diary text is NOT transmitted anywhere</p>
<h3>9.2 Privacy Protection</h3>
<p><strong>How This Protects Your Privacy:</strong><br />
- ✓ <strong>All NLP processing is LOCAL</strong> (happens on your iPhone/iPad only)<br />
- ✓ <strong>Diary content NEVER leaves your device</strong><br />
- ✓ <strong>No data sent to our servers, Claude AI, or any third party</strong><br />
- ✓ <strong>Keywords are NOT stored</strong> - analysis is performed in real-time when you view Soul Spark<br />
- ✓ <strong>You can disable</strong> by simply not using Soul Spark feature<br />
- ✓ <strong>Encrypted diary entries</strong> remain encrypted (AES-256-GCM) - NLP only processes unencrypted entries</p>
<p><strong>NLP Technology Used:</strong><br />
- <strong>Basic keyword matching</strong> using iOS natural language framework<br />
- <strong>NOT cloud-based AI</strong> - no GPT, Claude, or other cloud services involved<br />
- <strong>No machine learning</strong> - simple pattern matching only<br />
- <strong>No data collection</strong> - analysis results are not logged or stored</p>
<p><strong>You Control This:</strong><br />
- Don't use Soul Spark if you prefer no diary analysis<br />
- Lock diary entries to exclude them from NLP (locked entries are encrypted and skipped)<br />
